This is my rambling about my coding experience using flutter and some other.

I am a tech enthusiast and a junior software engineer.
I have a passion for technology that is both smart and versatile.
I believe that a good and versatile tech is what everyone need, and that's drive me to
participate in development of things that is easy to use.
